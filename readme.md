# Restaurant management system project

## The project Idea

This was a mini project I made in college using C programming language, it was made in order to practice data structures, specifically linked lists with its regular functions like adding, removing, editing, and so on.

using this app, a manager can enter using his own password which is typically 12345 and he can see all the data about the menu foods he has and he can edit these information, he can also look at clients and their data. meanwhile the client can create his own account and then purchase any food item.

What I learned:
- Practiced using singly linked lists in real world project by dealing with it like a database
